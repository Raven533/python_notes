# My Python Notes

### What is this?
In this repository I will put all my python notes that I take along the way of learning python.
These notes could be from the books I read or the videos I watch or anything that I think will be useful for checkout later if I forgot how something works down in the road.

### How to use them?
In order to use these notes, just run this command to copy them all to your local machine:</br>
`git clone https://github.com/Raven533/python_notes.git`</br>

- Note that these python files are not runnable by any means. They are just stacked up codes waiting for you to open them on a code editor (preferably a code editor with syntax highlighting like vscode) and read the comments and examples with them.

### What you can do?
- If you read the notes and they were useful, it would be great if you give this repo a star ‚≠ê and share it with your friends :)
- If you have any suggestions or changes for the notes, let me know by opening a pull request. I'd be happy to review and add your code into the main branch if it is good.
